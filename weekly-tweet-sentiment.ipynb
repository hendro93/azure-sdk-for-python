The max_results can be anywhere from 1 to 100 (but keep in mind that Azure Sentiment Analysis will only process a maximum of 10 records per request). If you are using a handle that would have more than 100 Tweets in a given week you may want to build in some logic to handle pagination or use a library such as [**searchtweets-labs**](https://github.com/twitterdev/search-tweets-python). The URL will need to be formatted to contain the max number of results and the query to say that you are looking for Tweets from a specific handle. You’ll return the formatted URL in a variable called url, since you will need it to make a get GET request later.\n",
